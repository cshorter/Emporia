# Device Data

The customer data that comes back from Emporia includes a list of
'devices' where a device may have multiple channels, such as a Vue 2
with many inputs.


# Data Retention Policy

According to [a forum thread](https://community.emporiaenergy.com/topic/minute-level-data-retention-limit/#post-7642)
the Emporia data retention policy is:

- 1 second data is retained for 3 hours.
- 1 min data is retained for 7 days.
- 1 hour / 1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 1 year data has unlimited retention.

The forum thread didn't mention the retention of 15 minute data at the time of the post.
